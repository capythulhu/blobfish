# blobfish

This binary allows you to dynamically sync files between GitHub repositories.

## 🐡 Install

You can install this package globally with:
```bash
npm install blobfish
```

## 🐡 Usage
Run the following command in your project root folder:
```bash
blobfish init
```
Or, manually create a `.blobfishrc` file in your project root folder. The file is a JSON array of objects with the following structure:
```json
[
  {
    "repo": "cool-org/awesome-repo",
    "files": [
      "path/to/file.js",
      {
        "from": "path/to/another_file.js",
        "to": "target/path/to/another_file.js"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
> As you can see, you can specify a file path to copy to, or just the file name to copy to the same directory.

Make sure you already have a GitHub token with the `repo` scope. You can create one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)

Then, create a `.env` file in your project root folder with the following content:
```bash
GH_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

Then, run the following command to sync your files:
```bash
blobfish sync
```

You can also run the ```blobfish sync``` command with the ```--token``` flag if you don't want to use a `.env` file:
```bash
blobfish sync --token <your_token>
```

And that's it! Your files will be copied to the specified repositories.
